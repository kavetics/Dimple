# Dimple
[Deedy Resume](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume) meets [Simple Resume](https://github.com/TusharRakheja/SimpleResume).

### Motivation
Two column resumes are great. They let you fit lots of details on a single page. However, after doing some manual eye-tracking  on recruiters at a career fair, I found out it is really hard for them to decide where to start reading before they give it a couple of glances. Two column resumes are **missing an anchor**. Solution: Single column resumes with as much space as two-column resumes.
